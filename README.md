# Genshin Wish Exporter

Electron + Vite + Vue3 + Tailwindcss

## Note

This is not made by me, original author: [biuuu](https://github.com/biuuu)

I only translated the text strings and made some visual adjustments on the exported excel (the default cell width is too small as Chinese characters are much shorter).

Do not use this tool if you are worried of getting banned even though this tool will not in any way modify the game files. It will only read necessary information available in the game files (and subsequently make wish history via API).

Have a nice day.
